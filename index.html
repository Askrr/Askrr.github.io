						Before enhancements, the classes Dog, Monkey, and RescueAnimal provided basic functionality for representing information about rescue animals. They included instance 
						variables for attributes such as name, breed, age, gender, weight, acquisition details, training status, reservation status, service location, vaccination status,
						 temperament, and special needs. The constructors and getter/setter methods facilitated the creation and manipulation of objects representing individual animals. 
						 However, the code lacked error handling, logging capabilities, and was not optimized for readability or scalability. It had also used in-program memory to
						 add animals to lists and arrays instead establishing a connection to an external database. <br><br>

						After enhancements, these classes underwent significant improvements in functionality, reliability, and maintainability. The additions of error handling mechanisms, 
						logging functionality, enhanced validation logic, and the connection to an outside database highly imploved the functionality and versatility of the program. The separation of concerns
						 and adherence to object-oriented principles made the code more modular and easier to understand. The inclusion of the sorting functionality in the Driver class extended 
						 the capabilities of the software, providing users with additional utility for managing and analyzing animal data. Overall, the enhanced classes better aligned with 
						 industry best practices, providing a solid foundation for building and extending the rescue animal management system.<br><br>
						 Alignment with course objectives:
						<ul>
						<li><i>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications:</i><br><br> These classes demonstrate professional-quality development through their 
							clear structure, appropriate naming conventions, and well-commented code. Additionally, the use of logging mechanisms enhances communication by providing a 
							record of program execution, aiding in debugging, and facilitating collaboration among developers.</li><br>
						<li><i>Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles:</i><br><br> Both the Dog and Monkey classes include methods for validating breed inputs 
							(isValidDogBreed and isValidMonkeyBreed), which demonstrate algorithmic decision-making to validate user inputs. The sortAnimals method in the Driver class further 
							showcases algorithmic principles by implementing sorting functionality for animal data based on different criteria.</li><br>
						<li><i>Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices:</i><br><br> These classes employ object-oriented programming 
							principles effectively, utilizing inheritance to extend functionality from the superclass RescueAnimal to the subclasses Dog and Monkey. The use of logging and exception 
							handling demonstrates proficiency in implementing error-handling mechanisms and enhancing the reliability of the software.</li><br>

						The Driver.java class, originating from the IT145 Application Development coursework, serves as the entry point for executing algorithms and data structures 
						related to animal rescue management. Originally, the Driver class provided basic functionality for sorting animal data using the quicksort algorithm and performing 
						binary search operations to locate specific animal records. However, the original implementation lacked comprehensive error handling mechanisms and optimization techniques. 
						Through enhancements made in Milestone Two, the Driver class underwent significant improvements, including the optimization of sorting and searching algorithms, integration 
						of error handling mechanisms, and enhancement of code readability. These enhancements transformed the Driver class into a well-rounded and efficient component of the animal
						rescue management system.<br><br>
						Alignment with course objectives:
						<ul>
							<li><i>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science:</i><br><br> 
								The enhancements made to the program, such as error handling and logging, contribute to building a collaborative environment. By incorporating strong error handling
								 mechanisms and logging events, the program becomes more reliable and user-friendly. This allows diverse audiences, including developers and stakeholders, to 
								 contribute to the program's development and decision-making process effectively.</li>	<br>
							<li><i>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to 
								specific audiences and contexts:</i><br><br> The program includes comments and documentation that explain the purpose and functionality of various methods and enhancements. 
								This ensures that the codebase is well-documented and understandable, contributing to professional-quality oral and written communication. Additionally, the logging 
								functionality provides a record of program execution, aiding in debugging and communicating system behavior effectively.</li><br>
							<li><i>Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its 
								solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices:</i><br><br> The program incorporates a sorting functionality that allows users to sort animals based
								 on different criteria such as name, age, and acquisition date. This demonstrates proficiency in algorithmic problem-solving and design choices, as the sorting 
								 algorithm effectively organizes and presents animal data in a structured manner. By managing trade-offs and implementing industry-standard practices, the program 
								 enhances its effectiveness in solving the specified problem.</li><br>

						The AnimalRepository.java class was developed as a crucial component of the database management system for the animal rescue management application. 
						This class was created from scratch to facilitate seamless interaction with the MySQL database, allowing for efficient handling of animal data transactions. 
						Initially conceived during the development phase of the project, the AnimalRepository class underwent significant enhancements to optimize database operations, 
						integrate error handling mechanisms, and improve overall code quality. These enhancements transformed the AnimalRepository class into a reliable 
						module essential for ensuring the integrity and efficiency of database interactions within the animal rescue management system.<br><br>
						Alignment with course objectives:
						<ul>
							<li>1.	<i>Employ strategies for building collaborative environments:</i><br><br> The integration of error handling mechanisms within the AnimalRepository 
								class fosters collaboration by ensuring that diverse audiences can support organizational decision-making. Effective error handling promotes transparent
								 communication and collaboration among stakeholders, enabling informed decisions regarding database operations.</li><br>	
							<li>2.	<i>Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications:</i><br><br> The enhancements made to the AnimalRepository class require coherent and 
								technically sound documentation to convey the implemented optimizations and error handling strategies. By producing clear and concise documentation, 
								the class communicates its functionality to specific audiences, ensuring that stakeholders understand the technical aspects of database management
								 within the application.</li><br>
							<li>3.	<i>Design and evaluate computing solutions:</i><br><br> The optimizations implemented in the AnimalRepository class align with this outcome by demonstrating the ability 
								to manage trade-offs involved in design choices, particularly regarding data structures and algorithms. Through careful evaluation and selection of database operations, 
								the class achieves efficient data retrieval and manipulation while managing performance trade-offs.</li><br>
